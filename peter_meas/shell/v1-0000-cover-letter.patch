Subject: [RFC PATCH v1 0/1] shell - peter_meas

Completed: 80-85%

I spent about 15-20 hours on this assignment so far, with more hours to
come. I have implemented the first seven features of the shell so far.
My approach was to implement and check each feature sequentially by
following assignment instructions and looking at linux manuals. I
implemented the prompt, basic input handling, and initial support for
built in commands such as exit and cd and exec. I finished
implementation from 2.0-2.7, which includes being able to print the
absolute path prompt and handle input lines, parsing input into
whitesapce delimited tokens and reporting unrecognized commands, to
implementing the built in commands like exit and cd with proper argument
validation anad error handling. Support for exec was also implemented as
per the assignment, to replace the shell process with a given/provided
executable when you run the ./shell. Implementation regarding being able
to xecute external commands in child processes using the clone syscall
and handling shared address space was also implemented. Basicallyon 2.8 now and I just still trying tofigure out the things I need to know in order to be able to do so, given I haven't learned much about piping since I take OS next year and my Comp Arc
class hasn't covered any of this yet.

Known issues before submission:

I've had to define some variables manually because my environment wasn't
picking up on them even though I have included all the right headers
I had issues at the start of my assigment with my uClibc not being
installed properly, or something was wrong with it so I had to reinstall
it

Overall, the shell meets the majority of the requirements and can be run
with QEMU, with everything up until 2.8 done.

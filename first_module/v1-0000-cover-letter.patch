Subject: [RFC PATCH v1 0/2] kernel_module - peter_meas

Completion : 30-40%

Work in progress. This series implements a kernel module that creates a
/proc/kdlp entry with a read-only interface returning a fixed message.

My apporach involved following the test-driven development methodology
by writing the spec file first to define exact behavior, then moving
on to implement tests using Test Anything Protcol before writing th
actual module code.

Patch 1 adds the complete module specification defining file
permissions, ownership, and operation behaviors while Patch 2 adds the
testing program which is currently in progress and will be completed in
the final submission.

Peter Meas (2):
  kernel_module: patch 1 - added specification.txt file
  kernel_module: patch 2 - test.c and makefile

Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] page_walk - peter_meas

Completion 100%

This patch series implements a system call for RISC-V that walks page
tables and returns translation information to the userspace.

I read RISC-V privileged spec chapter 4.3 and used resources like that
to help me implement syscall #257 to read SATP, walk page table levels,
 and return PTEs
I created test program exercising code, data, heap, stack, and mmap
regions, all tested in the QEMU VM, and analyzed flag combinations
(V,R,W,X,U,G,A,D)

I used resources such as the RISC-V privileged spec (section 4.3,4.4.1),
OSTEP chapters 18-20, linux kernel docs for adding syscalls
Fixed whitespace errors from V3
Signed-off-by: Peter Meas <peter_meas@fall2025-uml.kdlp.underground.software>

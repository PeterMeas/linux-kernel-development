Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] shell - peter_meas

Completion : 70-80%

I spent about 30-40 hours on this assignment so far, I attempted to
implement the first seven features of the shell. My approach was  to
implement and test each feature sequentially, following the assignment
instructions and looking up Linux manuals and documentation.

I implemented the prompt, basic input handling, and inital support for
built in commands. I completed impkementation from 2.0-2.7, which
included printing the absolute path prompt, handling input lines,
parsing input into whitespace delimited tokens, and reporting
unrecognized commands.

Execution of external commands in child processes using the clone
syscall and handling shared addrses space was also attempted at by me. I
tried implementing features 2.8 and 2.9 but I believe there are many
errors with them as they are not correctly running in the QEMU VM FOR
THE LAST part of the assignment. 

I had to define a lot of variables manually because my environment wasnt
picking them up, even though the appropriate headers were included.
Before I started the assignment also, my uClibc environment wasnt
working right so i basically did like a reinstall to compile the shell
correctly. 
Piping between commands is kind of broken when doing it through the qemu
vm, when i tested it locally through my makefile it was working fine.
